## A UL with pull quotes and paragraphs

1. Humans have money. At the moment no machines have agency (that we know of). Even the high frequency trading bots are explicitly doing the bidding of a human somewhere.

2. Humans care about 'irrational' things. We care about the story that a barista tells us about a coffee ("oh, I can really taste the life story of the grower" vs "ooh, this is black and hot"). Some of these things can be made to seem rational by casting them as signalling, but we certainly don't think of them that way. Because of this humans care about doing things that aren't well aligned with computer's wants.

3. Humans are good at human things, computer are good at computer things. That is a well understood distinction, but recently the line between the two has been moving over towards the computer. Computers can now recognise and describe objects in images, they can drive cars, they can win at Go. They are pretty terrible at opening doors and having goals of their own.

4. OK, that's the good things out of the way. Thing four is more or less thing three, but with a pessimistic slant on it. The things that you value as your key, human, irreplaceable traits are probably next on the list for AI to conquer. Things like coordination and negotiation are pretty human skills, but they are only really needed in situations with incomplete data.
 <figure class="half-width right">

 For example, in a construction context, architects talking to builders is largely to discuss things that were missing or unclear on the documents. This isn't a bad thing now because there are gains to be made in intuition. In the future I'd imagine that the documentation will me more complete, and will contain conditional information[^3]. We like to think that our key value is our ability to think, but actually, our ability to work in confined spaces might be just as important[^4]!

5. Most of what you do with your life is _not_ high value. I feel like I'm a smart valuable person. You probably do too. However I generate most of my value to an endeavour in _very_ short bursts. It could be 10 minutes of work that turn into a month's worth of my output. Some people are able to have higher outputs, but they are probably also assisted substantially by a support structure. Most of my life is spent getting ready for the next burst (reading, resting, doing important, but low value tasks). Hold that in your mind for a second.

    Part two of this is that it's very unlikely that a machine will "take your job" in the sense that they will replace you 100%. What is far more likely is that the machine will erode your usefulness. If you are a _thing-doer_ and your company employs 100 _thing-doers_, then it usually won't be a situation where they call you all into a meeting and say "someone has automated your jobs away, goodbye". Your job will become a bit more efficient, then when Bob retires and Mavis moves to Manitoba they won't be replaced. Then 98 of you will do 100 people's work and it won't be a stretch.

    > work will be hollowed out of all the bullshit that can be automated
    </figure>
    Putting these two together, what this will mean is that the effect that has hollowed out the demand for village musicians will do the same for most knowledge workers[^5]. The work will be hollowed out of all the bullshit that can be automated, and therefore will require fewer people to do it. I've already talked about [delegation](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2015/delegation-programming) and this will be another example of delegation to a non-human agent. The amount that this is possible will vary by occupation, so to get a good idea of how hard _yours_ will be take an inventory of your week using [Rescue Time](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2016/connecting-rescue-time-to-habitica-how-to-reward-yourself-for-doing-useful-things-without-using-up-all-your-brain-power) or something to give you an accurate picture of what you actually do. Then decide if you are the _only_ person who could do it. The percentage of stuff that _only you_ can do is probably the percentage of people who will be left.

6. I'll leave this list on an optimistic note. All of the above doom-mongering is based on a simple (and wrong) assumption that there will be no new jobs created. There will be growth in sectors that are currently small, and whole new sectors created. To take the shine off the enthusiasm, there's no guarantee that new job creation will continue to outpace deconstruction. This might be the time that things get out of hand!

> If you think about it, if you and I were playing a game of chess right now and we each had our 16 chess pieces. I moved, you moved, I’m against you and we’re both micromanaging our teams. What if for the dynamics of shared consciousness all of my chess pieces could decide on their own, and they could communicate amongst themselves. So, in fact you aren’t really playing me you’re playing the combined intelligence and flexibility of my 16 chess pieces. They can move whenever they want, they don’t have to wait for you to move.

> Suddenly you say well wait a minute that’s not fair, but that’s the environment we’re in now, you’re not against one iconic decision maker you’re against this networked set of competitors. Maybe they’re in coordination intentionally, maybe they’re unintentionally coordinating. So, what I would argue is chess actually may reinforce a more mechanical structured game than the world allows right now.
