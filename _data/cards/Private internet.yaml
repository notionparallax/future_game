        - Until the world wide web (www) became the dominant part of the internet there
          were lots of different ways that content could be shared. (Most of these still
          exist, but have comparable very small traffic.)
        - The internet is built out of open standards[^45]. The idea of a private internet
          is that a company with enough power will develop a rival information network with
          closed standards. The most likely candidates are Apple, Google and Facebook. For
          example, imagine that Apple developed a fast data-transfer protocol that you could
          only access from an apple device. They would go on to create a walled garden of
          content that only apple users could see.
        - This would impede the flow of information that the internet allows, but it may
          create a better experience for a subset of the population[^46].

    - Who would gain from a private internet?
    - What would be bad about companies developing private protocols?
    - Would it be safer and more secure?
