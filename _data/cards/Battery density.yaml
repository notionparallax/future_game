        - The ability to store energy and then release it later has been a constant human
          obsession. Mill ponds are there to turn water wheels when it isn't raining and
          clocks run on weights and springs that release their energy slowly.
        - Chemical batteries make that energy portable in a way that was previously inconceivable[^21].
        - Tesla's PowerWall batteries allow solar power to be used at night, and the same
          batteries that are inside the power wall are used in cars. These allow the power
          providers to load balance/peak shave so that they don't need to turn on more power
          stations to handle peak loads.

consider:
    - Peak loads cost power suppliers a lot of money, who else stands to gain from batteries
      apart from consumers?
    - Will consumers prefer ever thinner phones or longer battery lives. What would life
      be like if you only charged a phone once a month?
    - Will the distribution of metals that make up batteries change global trade/power?

    "21": "Watch springs are the obvious precedent, but their energy density is tiny in comparison."
