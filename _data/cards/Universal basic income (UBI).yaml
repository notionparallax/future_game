        - UBI is the idea that everyone in a society gets paid a stipend by the state. For
          example everyone gets $1000 every month, and any money you make on top of that
          (after tax) is yours.
        - "There is a lot of discussion about what _universal_, _basic_ and  _income_ actually
          mean in this context. Is _universal_: everyone inside the state's boundary, all
          citizens, all citizens over a certain age, all male landowning citizens? Is _basic_
          enough to not starve, enough to have a living wage?"
        - It's popular across the political spectrum, for different reasons. Small government
          advocates like it because it'll reduce reliance on the welfare state, big government
          advocates like it because it's a universal safety net.

consider:
    - What would you consider universal to mean? Basic? Income?
    - If you need more than the basic amount (e.g. disability allowance) will society
      look after you?
    - Would getting "free money" encourage people to not work?
