        - Screens have become bigger and denser. 'Retina' screens mean that we can get up
          close and not see pixels. "Don't get too close or you'll get square eyes" doesn't
          apply anymore.
        - Being able to get close to a screen means that we can change the relationship
          with them. Touch screens mean that we can interact directly with images.
        - "We're seeing flexible screens making a tentative step onto the market. Soon
          we might see screens that feel like they have a texture (buttons, roughness, etc.).
          We're also seeing screens in more places: on watches, as car dashboards, as billboards,
          inside VR headsets."

consider:
    - What other interface methods might supplant screens?
    - Will screens continue to get bigger and denser?
    - What will happen if screens stop being personal and are about shared experiences?
    - where else could we have screens?
