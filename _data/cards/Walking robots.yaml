        - Legs have lots of advantages over wheels. 2, 4 and more, legged robots are able
          to go places that wheeled and tracked vehicles can't[^40]. That means that we

    - What other sectors could these robots be used in?
    - Wheels need smooth surfaces, legs don't. Will we need fewer roads?
    - Does this have an outsized effect on humans' exceptional talent of mobility in difficult
      spaces? Will it affect employment?
