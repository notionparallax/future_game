        - This graph from NASA[^gt33] shows global temperature variation
        - '> "The paleoclimate record combined with global models shows past ice ages as
          well as periods even warmer than today. But the paleoclimate record also reveals
          that the current climatic warming is occurring much more rapidly than past warming
          events."'
        - Future temperature rises differ by the model used to predict them[^34] and by
          the way we act in the future[^35]. These will lead to sea level rise. Partially
          from melting ice, but also from the water in the oceans getting bigger from thermal
          expansion.

consider:
    - Who will warming be bad for?
    - Who will it be good for?
    - What will temperature increases trigger? And then what will those things trigger?
      and what will those things trigger? And so on.
