        - Managers and professionals showed strong reductions in hours worked between 1996
          and 2010 according to the ABS _Trends in Hours Worked_ report[^wh27].
        - Although it might not feel like it to us, the trends seem pretty clear, assuming
          that some other force doesn't come into play in the future.
        - This doesn't cover people who work multiple jobs and/or work for themselves (which
          could be entrepreneurs, or it could be Uber drivers).

consider:
    - John Maynard Keynes thought that we'd be working a 15 hour week by now[^wh28]. Will
      that come in the future? Will this downward trend continue?
    - What else will affect working hours?
    - Working hours only capture work in paid employment. What other kinds of work are
      there and how much of them are we doing? (volunteering, housework, etc.)
