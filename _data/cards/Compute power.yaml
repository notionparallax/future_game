        - "The number of transistors on a microchip has doubled every 18 months or so since
          transistors were invented. This was first spotted by Gordon Moore, and the phenomenon
          is named after him: Moore's Law[^9]. More transistors means more calculations
          can be done in a given time. That means that computers can do more of what we
          want, feel smoother and more responsive."
        - Not only is each computer more powerful, but there are also more computers in
          the world. We all have computers in our pockets. There are giant data centres
          anywhere that a source of electricity or cooling can be found[^10]. Put simply,
          there is a massive amount of raw computing power in the world, and the rate of
          its increase is increasing[^11].

    - Does more power unlock answers to new kinds of problem? Google search wouldn't be
      possible without a certain level of computer power. What new kinds of activity will
      be unlocked by more power?
    - More compute power needs more electrical power. Where will this electricity come
      from?
    - Does everyone have equal access to this compute power?
    - Will we ever have _enough_ computer power?
