        - Let's define drones as a class of robots that are able to do a human's bidding
          with _some_ level of autonomy. That might just be the ability to hover level,
          or it might be full autonomy over an assassination mission.
        - There are drones deployed in military situations, drones do the vacuuming, drones
          do aerial filming. The list of things that drones can do is only limited by how
          far we can imagine at the moment.
        - Most drones only have limited autonomy, but that is changing in military applications
          and will change in commercial and domestic ones too.
        - We can send drones to dangerous or inaccessible places. Wriggling into pipes to
          look for leaks, or flying over cliffs to count sea birds.
        - Drones were used to attack the Saudi Aramco oil refinery; this was consumer tech,
          used in a military context.

consider:
    - What if drones get so small that we can't see them?
    - Could warfare become entirely autonomous?
    - What new types of jobs or applications might emerge for drones?
    - Will drones displace a significant part of the labour force?
