        - Quantum computers are able to solve a particular type of problem incredibly fast.
          Unfortunately, that particular type of problem is the one that the world's encryption
          systems are based on.
        - Quantum computers are currently a research curiosity, if they become a real world
          technology then all internet transactions will fail. (Unless credit card companies
          and banks take action before then to upgrade to quantum encryption.)
        - From a more optimistic angle, once computer scientists work out how to phrase
          their problems in the way that quantum computers like, lots of
        - very hard problems become quite easy!

    - How much disruption would it cause if electronic money, and other encryption methods,
      stopped working?
    - If protein folding was solved, what would it mean for the pharma industry?
