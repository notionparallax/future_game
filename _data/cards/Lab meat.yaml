        - Ruminants, like cows and sheep, emit a lot of greenhouse gasses. They are also
          sentient beings. Those are two pretty compelling reasons not to eat them. However,

          in a lab, then we can have all the upsides without any of the downsides.

    - Will we start to design meats that aren't copies of animals?
    - Will lab meat ever overcome the yuk factor?
    - What will happen to the meat industry? What about the animals that are already alive?
    - What will we do with all the spare land that is freed up?
