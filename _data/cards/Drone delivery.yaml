        - On the surface, drone delivery is about pandering to rich people's whims. "I want a \[insert thing here\] now! Minimalism has been described as a thing that only the rich can afford&mdash;everyone else needs to have backups![^min] That could change if drone delivery takes off  in a big way. You needn't actually own anything because it could be delivered to you within a few minutes.
        - The resources needed for everyone to own a ukulele could be put into making a few really good ones with energy left over to make other things.
        - Drones could also be used to deliver medicine and other essentials to places that don't have fixed infrastructure like roads or power for refrigeration. E.g. taking a shepherd's insulin to her on the side of a hill.

consider:
    - How many of your belongings could you live without if just-in-time delivery was
      possible?
    - Can medical assistance be 'delivered'?
    - What things of yours would and wouldn't you share if a drone would pick it up and
      drop it off for you?
    - What other infrastructure does this make obsolete?
    - Could deliveries be made to apartment windows on high levels? How would the window
      need to change?
