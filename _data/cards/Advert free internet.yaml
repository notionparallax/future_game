        - The dominant business model of the internet is making a service that people
          use, and then serving adverts to those people while they're there. If you
          could opt out of those adverts there would need to be some other kind of
          value transfer to make the service worth running.
        - Each time an ad is served (an impression), it costs the advertiser a tiny
          amount of money, more if it's clicked. These sums would be dwarfed by
          transaction fees as an impression is in the order of $0.012 per impression
          and a transaction fee is somewhere between $0.03 and $0.30. So the payments
          would need to be aggregated by another party before being passed to the banks.

consider:
    - Would you pay money to avoid adverts?
    - Adverts make you aware of products and services that potentially make your life better. Would you suffer without them?
    - How would graphic design trends change if there was less to put on the page?
    - If the wealthy paid not to see ads, would ads change? Wealthy customers are worth more to advertise to, would people need to pay a % of their wealth to avoid adverts?

    "blendle": "[Blendle is a Dutch online news platform that aggregates articles from a variety of newspapers and magazines and sells them on a pay-per-article basis. The key differences to similar websites are the participation by otherwise commercially unrelated news services in a single platform and the ability for registered users to easily pay a small price per article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blendle)"
