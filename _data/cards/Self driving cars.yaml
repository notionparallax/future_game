        - From a long shot dream in 2004[^37] driverless cars are now more of a _when_ than
          an if.
        - Humans need a lot of tolerance to account for their imperfect driving skills.
          That means that the lanes need to be wider, cars need more impact protection,
          cars need to drive further apart.
        - Cars also represent freedom for a lot of people. Owning a car means that for a
          large proportion of the day each car is idle. When cars drive themselves it's
          unlikely that anyone will own a car. Cars will provide mobility. That means that
          parking will be eliminated, freeing up almost half of the current road network
          and many structures currently dedicated to parking.
        - While not driving, people will be free to do other things. They could sleep, have
          meetings, eat, relax, etc.
        - '> "To generations of Americans, owning a car represented freedom. To the next
          generation, not owning a car will represent freedom."[^38]'

consider:
    - Will this replace mass transit?
    - Current cars are styled to face forwards, and to be a little bit like racing cars.
      What will future cars be like?
    - What will this do to ownership models? Will it be transport as a service?
    - What effect will this have on moral standards (drink driving) or sexual freedom?
