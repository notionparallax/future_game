        - Money developed as a special case of any unit of exchange. That could be sheep,
          cows and camels, or silver and gold. At some point someone made an object that
          stood in for the direct value of those objects and that became the money that
          we recognise today.

      basis[^44].
    - How will we manage the volatility?
