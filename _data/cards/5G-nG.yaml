        - Each increase in G increases connectivity speed, and changes the types of
          things that you can do while connected to that network. 3G allowed full
          webpages rather than just WAP[^wap].
        - 5G untethers broadband speeds from the geographical constraints of
          fibre optic or copper networks. Once there's a 5G network in place,
          high tech applications can be set up with no digging, it also allows
          for easy reconfiguration of data rich robotics in warehouses.
        - Conspiracy theorists think it's a mind control mechanism.
