    - What causes there to be three groups?
    - What do the countries in the three groups have in common? What do UAE, Brunei and
      Libya have in common?
    - What leverage are the countries that are getting richer able to use that the countries
      that are static don't have access to?
    - Is GDP even a useful measure? What would the world be like if we measured something
      else, or a range of things?
