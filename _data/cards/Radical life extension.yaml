        - The first children to get to 150 years old have already been born. Radical life
          extension advocates think that it's possible to push that number much higher.
        - Technically nobody dies of old age. They die of diseases that old age makes us
          more susceptible to. Life extension advocates extending the useful period of one's
          life to make 90 the new 40.
        - Immortal fictional characters often long for death, but usually because they are
          tired of their friends dying. If everyone lived a long time they would probably
          be pretty happy about it.

consider:
    - What would you do with another lifetime?
    - Which decade of your life would you like life extension to extend? Would you be
      in your 20s for 50 years? Teens? 40s?
    - If you could push your healthspan, at the cost of your lifespan, would you? (I.e.
      live in a 25 year old body until you are 60, then drop dead.)
