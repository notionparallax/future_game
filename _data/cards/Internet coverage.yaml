        - In the last quarter of a century the internet has changed the way the world operates.
          Access to the internet isn't ubiquitous. A large part of the world can't access
          what we take for granted. Projects like Facebook's internet.org[^ic31] and Google's
          Project Loon[^ic32] were trying to change that but their parent company's deemed
          them unprofitable.
        - Those unconnected people stand to gain from internet access and are also a giant
          market. The countries at the bottom of this graph have little in the way of fixed
          infrastructure, so may leapfrog the countries at the top of the graph if satellite
          internet becomes the norm.

consider:
    - What could a society do if the penetration was 100%? Online democracy? Compete in
      a global job market?
    - What is preventing the last few % from being connected? Is it choice or something
      else?
