        - Amazon is now bigger than Walmart. The internet allows companies to centralise
          services. This is a long running trend; in 1850 your village  would have a singer
          and someone who played an instrument for entertainment, but with the introduction
          of music recording the wealth from entertainment was concentrated into the very
          best entertainers. The same is happening to education and news providers.
        - This has also enabled the "long tail", catering to ever more specific groups of
          people, but the bulk of everyone's needs can be fulfilled by Amazon.
        - With increasing globalisation, more and more services will be provided by a centralised
          organisation, even if that organisation is coordinating others (e.g. Uber and
          AirBnB).

consider:
    - Companies like Amazon and Ebay provide marketplace services to smaller companies;
      connecting them to consumers. What are the impacts of this?
    - Do we have all our eggs in one basket?
    - Do we (consumers) stand to gain from an arms race?
    - Politicians talk about "breaking up big tech". What effect would this have?
