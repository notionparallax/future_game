        - The Horsepower was a measure of the work that one horse could do. The horse was
          the engine of most economies until the internal combustion engine displaced it.
          This was one of the first real examples of large scale disruption[^14].
        - Horses were no longer a requirement, and people quickly moved over to engines
          to provide motive force. Horses stayed for recreational use, but in tiny numbers
          compared to their previous penetration.
        - This is interesting, but it's also a metaphor for a change from one entrenched
          technology to another. The disruption to the world can be huge.

consider:
    - Why did people prefer engines to horses?
    - What was the core function that the horse performed?
    - If you think of this as a pattern, what might replace the car?
    - What other historical technological revolutions fit the same pattern? What current
      technologies are vulnerable to it?
