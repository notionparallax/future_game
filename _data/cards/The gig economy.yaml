        - Most people tend to work for one employer, and then they will move from project
          to project for the same employer.  The Hollywood model means that you complete
          a project and then go back into the market for employment.
        - Its a bit like being a freelancer or consultant. People in this system get regular
          price signals about their economic value. 'Stars' will be paid a lot, but if you
          aren't really in demand you may struggle to get a job.
        - These sorts of jobs offer very accessible employment, at the cost of long term
          precarity, i.e. very little stability in their financial situation.
        - This may erode certain employment benefits that have traditionally existed. It
          also allows really talented people to maximally realise their value.

    - Can humans be trusted to manage their own retirement funds, holiday allowance, etc?
    - Would you be able to process the price signals well enough to get the best out of
      life?
    - What will it mean for companies?[^55]
    - How does everyone employed as an individual 'contractor' improve or affect our economy,
      society, built environment?
