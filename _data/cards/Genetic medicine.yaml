        - Medicine has developed to a point where it is incredibly good at treating an imaginary,
          statistically normal person. Each variable that could be part of your health has
          a statistical range that is 'normal', perhaps subdivided by age, or sex, or race
          if you are lucky.
        - Genetic medicine is focused on treating each patient as an individual[^47]. Those
          ranges would be hugely more specific. Based on your genetic markers you may need
          to keep your potassium levels between X1 and X2. This leads to much more preventative
          medicine being possible. This ultimately reduces the spending needed to achieve
          a given level of health and also makes it possible to increase general health
          for everyone.
        - All that statistical specificity unlocks a dystopian side. Health insurers can
          make much more accurate predictions about the true cost of insuring a person.
          This means that people at risk of the worst diseases will also find it the hardest
          to get health insurance.

consider:
    - Will this make us healthier?
    - Will we choose mates who are genetically different to us, or to try to reduce the
      likelihood of complications?
    - Will it lead to people being denied healthcare/insurance?
