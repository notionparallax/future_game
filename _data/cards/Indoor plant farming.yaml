        - Plants are green because they reflect the green part of the visual light spectrum;
          it turns out that plants need mainly pink light to photosynthesise. 1m of solar
          panels can generate more than 1m of pink light, so it's very resource efficient.
        - The plants are grown in racks, in a sealed warehouse. Each rack has lighting and
          a water supply with nutrients in it. Because the building is sealed, there's no
          need for pesticides because there are no pests. Because the plants are in racks,
          each square metre on the floor can produce tens of square metres of plants.

consider:
    - If we do this, what will happen to the farming industry?
    - What would happen to all the land that is currently used to grow plants?
    - Not all plants can be grown like this. Plants that are tall are particularly unsuited,
      e.g. fruit and corn. How will our diets shift to reflect the price differences?
