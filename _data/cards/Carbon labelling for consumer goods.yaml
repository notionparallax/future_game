        - "Like nutrition facts on food, listing carbon expenditures[^co2expenditure] related to various products on their packaging or in marketing materials will become a norm. This could be used to justify higher prices[^fasionpricing] for certain more \u201Ccarbon-responsible\u201D items."

consider:
    - Is there space on the packaging? Packaging itself has a CO<sub>2</sub> cost.
    - Does the public have the topic-literacy to understand carbon labelling? What other comms would need to accompany this?
    - How would it account for varying CO<sub>2</sub> quantities by season and location of end consumer? E.g. a Summer cheese would make less CO<sub>2</sub> because the cows don't need heating and eat grass, but if it was flown from France to Australia it would have a high CO<sub>2</sub> quantity. Where would the labelling be done?
