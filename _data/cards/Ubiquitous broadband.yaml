        - Broadband internet unlocks so much of our urban economy in the developed world
          but that is a small part of the earth's surface.
        - What would access to broadband do for rural African farmers, or for Antarctic
          explorers?
        - Google had project Loon, Facebook tried giant autonomous planes that act as repeater
          stations to the ground. SpaceX _is_ putting a network of toaster-sized internet-satellites
          into orbit and .
        - If everyone in the world has access to the same markets it would have a huge levelling
          effect. It might raise the incomes of the poorest, but it might well lower the
          incomes of the most well-off.

consider:
    - What can you do with fast internet that you can't with slow internet?
    - Could the world's best robotic surgeons operate on the cases that most needed their
      help, regardless of how close they were to a big hospital?
    - Could low income Indian children get educated by the best teachers?
    - Could Ethiopian graphic designers sell their expertise to Chilean wine producers?
    - What are the exponential potentials with this card?
    - If broadband is ubiquitous (e.g. available in national parks), will it be possible
      to get away from it? Is this a good thing? Is it a technology problem or a social
      problem?
