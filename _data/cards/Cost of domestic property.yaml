        - Housing is more expensive (in real terms) than ever. As a proportion of the money that people have to spend, we are spending more of it on housing.
        - This might be because there isn't enough supply of housing where people want to live. It might be because housing is a safe asset class.
        - Low interest rates make it easier for those with wealth to buy more houses, and house values go up much faster than most other asset classes. Are we in a bubble?
        - If owning stops being attractive, wealth concentration will increase, but maybe a new _safe as x_ asset class will emerge for renters to spend their money on.

consider:
    - How did we get to the position that we're in now?
    - What other explanations could there be for these trends that aren't the obvious
      ones?
    - What would reduce the pressure on the market?
    - Is expensive housing desirable?
    - Is the current model of how we live going to survive the rise in price?
