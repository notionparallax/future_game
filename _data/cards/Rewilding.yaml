        - Cities and suburbs are looking for places to downshift development and add urban greenery[^urbanGreenery] to compensate for rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Especially if carbon sequestration is eventually monetized, this could have an impact on land use overall, since owning undeveloped forest land would be profitable. This permaculture land ownership.
        - Progress in ancient DNA recovery is leading some to suggest rewilding with currently extinct fauna[^plPark].
card_type: nature
consider:
    - Will this lead to a sharper distinction between urban and wild?
    - How will we interact with the apex predators (bears, wolves, etc.) that are needed for a functional ecosystem?
    - Will governments need to compulsory purchase the land from farmers, or will there be another way to incentivise rewilding? Maybe an emissions scheme, or fallow payments?
