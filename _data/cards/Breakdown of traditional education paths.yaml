          for millions, new relationships to online learning will continue to flourish,
          in addition to trends like unschooling, which will penetrate new demographics

          also draw people away from the traditional path of college education.

    - What is the value proposition of universities? Why not just move somewhere
      extremely cheap and do MOOCs for 3 years?
    - Is education about getting smarter, or about conforming, and signalling that conformance?
    - As we live longer what is happening to the proportion of our lives we spend in education?
    - Why do we generally educate in one block? Is that better than, for example, 2 years a decade?
