        - The NSW _Department of Infrastructure Planning and Natural Resources_ estimates
          that 60% of the world's population will be living within cities by the year 2030
          and about 91.1% of the Australian population will live in cities. They expected
          the population in the Sydney Region alone to grow by a net increase of 40,500
          per year.
        - The forecast demand for new residential development to support Sydney's current
          population is 25,000 dwellings per year over the next ten years, with 25% of that
          growth  located in Greenfield sites on the urban periphery and Greater Metropolitan
          Region corridors.
        - With the enlarging population and increasing urbanisation the demands on resources
          will contribute to further degradation of the Australian environment and Sydney's
          ever expanding urban sprawl.

consider:
    - Is it inevitable that the urbanisation trend will continue?
    - Can we bring traditionally rural activities into cities too?
    - What benefits could come from even greater urban density?
    - What mistakes are cities making right now that we might not make in the future?
