        - Single use plastic items are low capital cost, but have a significant environmental
          impact as they don't break down for centuries. This has had a particular effect
          on marine wildlife.
        - Some jurisdictions have banned single use bags and drinking straws. Others have
          banned _all_ plastic, single use items.

consider:
    - Will this lead to people carrying more with them (steel straw, etc.), or will people
      move to eating-in more?
    - Does this trend affect anyone negatively? If there are no straws available, will
      disabled people be further disadvantaged? How do you feel about this?
    - How much further should this be taken? What else should be banned? What should _not_
      be banned?
    - If plastic from one country damages the ocean wildlife from another country, what
      should the wronged country do?
