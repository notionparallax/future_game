        - "More invasive procedures such as surgical facelifts will regain popularity \u2013  people are tired of paying over and over for fillers[^faceFillers], which is more like a subscription model.  Superusers say a surgical facelift is cheaper in the long run, and forecasts  seem to be aligned with them, as the plastic surgery sector will continue to  boom overall."
card_type: trend
consider:
    - beauty standards are variable, is doing something permanent a risk?
    - has the facelift got too much of a bad reputation from 80s stars who look bad in their old age?
    - How would this trend generalise to other things? The permanence is embraced in tattoos already?
    - how does this sit with trends towards body positivity?
