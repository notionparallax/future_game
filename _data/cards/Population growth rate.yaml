        - The world population is growing by 200,000 daily. Population increases are expected
          to level out globally between 2030 and 2100[^2], but that's an aggregate value.
          Some countries will still be growing fast whilst others will be shrinking (looking
          at you Japan).
        - There are a lot of factors to population growth. Better sanitation means fewer
          children die. Better access to education for women means that fewer children are
          born. People living longer means that people hang about for longer. Wars push
          people out of countries, prosperity pulls them in.

    - What job will all these new people do?
    - What will they eat?
    - Where will they live?
    - What factors will drive migration?
    - What limiting factors are there on Australian population growth? What could we do
      to remove those limitations?
